# A Responsive Portfolio Website

**Original creator: Brad Traversy (bradtraversy)**

**This is a fork of bradtraversy's master branch.**

This project is my first attempt to create a responsive web application that can host my work and project portfolio.

I learned how to:

- Create a web application from HTML, CSS, and Javascript without any frameworks or bootstrap
- Implement media queries to allow the application to become responsive to different screen sizes (mobile to widescreen)
- Apply partial SCSS files to modularize my CSS

Technologies used/not used:

- HTML5
- CSS3
- SCSS
- Javascript
- NodeJS
- No frameworks
- No bootstrap
