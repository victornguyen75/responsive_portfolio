# A Responsive Portfolio Website

**Original creator: Brad Traversy (bradtraversy)**

**This is a fork of bradtraversy's master branch.**

This project is my first attempt to create a responsive web application that can host my work and project portfolio. As a prototype, this website does not truly reperesent my full work, and I'm using this as a template for the future. [Check out my modern, responsive website here!](https://victornguyen75.github.io/responsive_portfolio_website/)

I learned how to:

- Create a web application from HTML, CSS, and Javascript without any frameworks or bootstrap
- Implement media queries to allow the application to become responsive to different screen sizes (mobile to widescreen)
- Apply partial SCSS files to modularize my CSS
- Deploy this application on GitHub pages and Heroku
- Troubleshoot GitHub page's problems with image URLs

Technologies used/not used:

- HTML5
- CSS3
- SCSS
- Javascript
- NodeJS
- No frameworks
- No bootstrap
